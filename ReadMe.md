## Basic Saber Repo

Designed to display the various latex documents I have created over the years


With the rich set of features that saber has, and the ease of dumping markdown files into the repo, this is viable alternative to vuepress, however error handling seems to be behind vuepress.


Also add [https://saber.land/docs/saber-config.html#linenumbers](markdown) plugins at some point.

Built on CircleCI.
